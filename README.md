## Background

As per Wikipedia, Nvidia Optimus is a computer GPU switching technology created by Nvidia which, depending on the resource load generated by client software applications, will seamlessly switch between two graphics...

However this technology has some issues on some Windows 10 laptop, such as my Clevo-based laptop which featuring Intel i5-8300H + NVIDIA GTX 1050. When there is no program using NVIDIA, there will be some random stuttering issue which, when it happens, the mouse would freeze for a brief moment. This leads to very unpleasant experience.

Some fellows on Reddit also reported the same issue. While some claimed that recent version of Windows 10 resolved this issue, it still happens on my Win10 Version 1909, hence the creation of this program.
